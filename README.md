This project is about analyzing SuperStore sales data using Power BI.
Used the dataset to understand how sales and profit are performing, which categories and regions are doing well, and how customers are segmented. The data was cleaned first and then loaded into Power BI.
Main KPIs like total sales, total profit, profit margin, total orders, and average shipping days were calculated using DAX. The dashboard is designed as a single-page summary with KPIs at the top and a few main charts to show trends, category performance, regional sales, and customer segments. 
Detailed data is kept on other pages to keep the main dashboard simple and clear. 
Overall, this project shows how raw sales data can be turned into useful insights using Power BI.
